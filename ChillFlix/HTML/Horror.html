            <p style="text-align: left;">
                The ideology behind our current horror films are said to be derived from ancient Greek mythology. 
                Greek myths not only comprise of tales of gods and humans, but also tales of frightening, morbid creatures that we have 
                now termed monsters. For example, bronze footed creatures known as empousa, who would drink the blood of men, are said 
                to be the precursors of vampires.

            <p style="text-align: right;">
                These myths as well as myths of other cultures inspired folklores and superstitions in Europe during the Middle Ages. 
                When Christianity was prevalent in Europe it gave rise to the myths of witches and demons for a long time until eventually 
                the Age of Enlightenment took over. The intellectuals of this time debated the existence of such creatures with logic and 
                rationalism.

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                However, writers used these ideas in their work. A group of writers known as “The Graveyard Poets” are credited 
                by historians as the precursor of gothic literature. A man named Horace Walpole is credited with writing the first gothic 
                novel known as “The Castle of Otranto” in 1764. Walpole alleged that his book was a translation of Italian book. Gothic novels 
                embody the themes of uncanny, unnatural elements of architecture during that time. Many more gothic novels were published afterwards.

                During the early 1800s two books that were vital in creating the horror genre were released. 
                The first being Frankenstein, which was written by Mary Shelley and published in 1818. This book took inspiration from 
                Greek mythology, more specifically Prometheus, the book was also called “The Modern Prometheus”.
                The second book was John Polidori’s short story “The Vampyre” which was published in 1819. This book features a vampire 
                that feeds off the blood of young women. 70 years later another book known as “Dracula” by Bram Stoker also had a 
                vampire that feasted on the blood of innocents. However, John Polidori is credited with creating the first vampire 
                in fiction novels.

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                In the early 1900s many films,based off books, that had similarities to classic Hollywood horror movies were 
                released. Although back then the term horror was not used to describe them. It wasn’t until the film Dracula starring 
                Bela Lugosi was released that the new era of cinematic horror began.
